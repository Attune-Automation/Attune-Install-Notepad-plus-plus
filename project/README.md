Notepad++ stands as a cost-free open-source code editor and substitute for 
the traditional Notepad application. It provides support for numerous 
programming languages. Operating within the MS Windows ecosystem, its usage 
is regulated by the GNU General Public License.

Constructed upon the robust editing framework Scintilla, Notepad++ is 
crafted using C++ and relies on the pure Win32 API and STL. This foundation 
ensures heightened execution speed and a more compact program size. By 
meticulously streamlining numerous processes without sacrificing 
user-friendliness. By conserving CPU resources, the computer can reduce 
its processing capacity and consequently lower power consumption.
